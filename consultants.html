            <p>Jennifer is an American human who was raised in the UK. Her
                priorities include sharing time with her tribe and loved ones,
                perfecting her handstand, and consuming all of the cheese she
                can get her hands on. She's an entrepreneur of many trades and
                the founder of a
                <a href="//seekhealing.org" target="_blank">non-profit project</a>
                focused on opioid addiction recovery. A bit of
                nomad, it's almost impossible to guess what city she's in at any
                given time without access to her Google Calendar. She graduated
                with a bachelor's degree in Linguistics from the University of
                North Carolina - Chapel Hill and speaks English, French,
                Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese with varying degrees of
                proficiency. Jennifer identifies as female, pansexual, and
                non-monogamous and is passionate about becoming a better human
                being, regardless of the labels that may apply.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Jennifer assisted me in helping my wife and I
                            actively and consciously create definitions and
                            boundaries in our relationship. She helped us
                            identify what we were doing out of habit, out of
                            assumption, or out of external cultural expectation.
                            As a result, she helped us lay the groundwork to
                            forgive one another, to move forward, and to decide
                            to be happier humans.</p>
                        <p>Jennifer's compassion is unparalleled. Her clear and
                            effective use of language inspired me to grow in my
                            own communication skills. And she truly is guided by
                            no agenda other than love.</p>
                        <p>In whatever capacity you might be able to have
                            Jennifer bring her light into your life, you'll
                            undoubtedly find yourself pushed and emboldened to
                            be an agent of change and growth for yourself. She
                            gives each of us a lens by which we can discover for
                            ourselves the better human we're capable of
                            becoming.</p>

                        <p>Jennifer is a wonderful, amazing, beautiful and
                            unique Officiant. We requested a non-religious,
                            non-denominational ceremony. It was very short
                            notice but she took the time to meet with us, and
                            keep constant communication. She asked us very
                            thought provoking questions that really spoke to us
                            as individuals and then as a couple. The ceremony
                            she performed was extremely intimate and very
                            personal. She spoke about everything we had talked
                            to her about in the weeks prior to the ceremony.
                            Even though all her words were scripted she spoke
                            them with such ease and conviction; making everyone
                            in the ceremony feel her words too. There was not a
                            dry eye in that room!! We wanted a small, intimate
                            ceremony and that’s exactly what she gave us. She
                            was more than our officiant, she felt like a friend
                            and family member. Multiple people asked if she
                            really was. That's how great and amazing she is!</p>

            <h2>Madeline Rose Parker</h2>
            <p class="small"><i>AMM Minister ID: 661710</i></p>
            <p>Madeline spent her first 18 years in Chapel Hill, North Carolina before heading off to school at Davidson College. 
                She gained a degree from Davidson as an English major and Sexuality and Gender Studies minor - two subjects that she’s 
                felt passionate about exploring both academically and outside of the classroom since she was a young girl
                (her mother knew they were in trouble when she started debating gender and feminism ethics at the dinner table with family friends at age 7). 
                Post-college, Madeline spent a year and a half in Washington D.C. to work with the mental health LGBTQ youth focused 
                non-profit organization The Trevor Project. As bright as the city lights are and as many opportunities as D.C. has to 
                offer, she has since gravitated back to the Triangle because of how much it still feels like home. She values human connection and honesty, 
                emboldened exploration and adventure, and constant unrelenting curiosity above all else. Madeline plans to return to school to 
                pursue an MFA in a year or two because she wants to work in couple’s and sex counseling, with a particular focus on those who identify as 
                LGBTQ, non-mono, and/or non-vanilla. Currently, not enough resources are available for those who exist outside of traditional, 
                heteronormative structures, and she wants to do what she can to help improve upon this problem. Madeline identifies as queer, pansexual, 
                and ethically non-monogamous, but she recognizes and honors the great diversity of ways that humans experience and demonstrate 
                the love in their lives and simply wants to assist in allowing others to manifest that love however resonates most with them.
