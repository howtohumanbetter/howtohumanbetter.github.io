            <p>Jennifer is an American human who was raised in the UK. Her
                priorities include sharing time with her tribe and loved ones,
                perfecting her handstand, and consuming all of the cheese she
                can get her hands on. She's an entrepreneur of many trades and
                the founder of a
                <a href="//seekhealing.org" target="_blank">non-profit project</a>
                focused on opioid addiction recovery. A bit of
                nomad, it's almost impossible to guess what city she's in at any
                given time without access to her Google Calendar. She graduated
                with a bachelor's degree in Linguistics from the University of
                North Carolina - Chapel Hill and speaks English, French,
                Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese with varying degrees of
                proficiency. Jennifer identifies as female, pansexual, and
                non-monogamous and is passionate about becoming a better human
                being, regardless of the labels that may apply.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Jennifer assisted me in helping my wife and I
                            actively and consciously create definitions and
                            boundaries in our relationship. She helped us
                            identify what we were doing out of habit, out of
                            assumption, or out of external cultural expectation.
                            As a result, she helped us lay the groundwork to
                            forgive one another, to move forward, and to decide
                            to be happier humans.</p>
                        <p>Jennifer's compassion is unparalleled. Her clear and
                            effective use of language inspired me to grow in my
                            own communication skills. And she truly is guided by
                            no agenda other than love.</p>
                        <p>In whatever capacity you might be able to have
                            Jennifer bring her light into your life, you'll
                            undoubtedly find yourself pushed and emboldened to
                            be an agent of change and growth for yourself. She
                            gives each of us a lens by which we can discover for
                            ourselves the better human we're capable of
                            becoming.</p>

                        <p>Jennifer is a wonderful, amazing, beautiful and
                            unique Officiant. We requested a non-religious,
                            non-denominational ceremony. It was very short
                            notice but she took the time to meet with us, and
                            keep constant communication. She asked us very
                            thought provoking questions that really spoke to us
                            as individuals and then as a couple. The ceremony
                            she performed was extremely intimate and very
                            personal. She spoke about everything we had talked
                            to her about in the weeks prior to the ceremony.
                            Even though all her words were scripted she spoke
                            them with such ease and conviction; making everyone
                            in the ceremony feel her words too. There was not a
                            dry eye in that room!! We wanted a small, intimate
                            ceremony and that’s exactly what she gave us. She
                            was more than our officiant, she felt like a friend
                            and family member. Multiple people asked if she
                            really was. That's how great and amazing she is!</p>
