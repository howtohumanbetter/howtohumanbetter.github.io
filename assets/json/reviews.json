By being intentional and honoring your truth as a couple, it can be a sacred moment that sets a loving and celebratory tone: both for the reception party and the lifetime you're preparing to spend together.\r\n \r\nWhat working with me is like:\r\n \r\nMy focus is pre-ceremony partnership and providing you with cognitive & spiritual guidance as you set intentions for your marriage. I've found this is much more effective for my clients than traditional pre-marital counseling, which tends to be very problem-oriented. It's also important (and just fun) for us to develop a friendship before the wedding. Building trust and getting to know you as a couple will allow me to design & lead a ceremony that feels intimate and highly personalized to the story of your relationship. \r\n \r\nShort summary of my technique:\r\n \r\nIn our work together, I'll use practical mindfulness tools as well as a variety of unique practices from cross-cultural spiritual traditions. My non-religious ceremony flow is always slightly different for every couple I work with, but includes a number of standard elements that will make your event memorable: including a \"Promises Box.\" \r\n \r\nHow my ceremonies feel:\r\n \r\nI am a strong public speaker and can always adapt my tone as needed, but naturally, my style comes across as light-hearted and genuine. I can accommodate both religious and non-religious weddings, and love to design unique interfaith ceremonies: but regardless of your particular spiritual flavor, the wedding will feel unique and non-traditional. There's usually plenty of laughter, as well as intentional moments of sacredness and reverence that belong in a church or temple.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nShoot me a text or give me a call today at 703-935-4747 and I'll help you find the right words to infuse your ceremony with intention and authentic connection.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n*Proudly offering licensed officiation for heterosexual, homosexual, monogamous, and non-monogamous ceremonies.*","review_count":13,"allow_in_person_appointments":"no","storefront_reviews_url":"https://www.weddingwire.com/reviews/how-to-human-better-jennifer-nicolaisen-asheville/a894c024355fd175.html","average_service_score":"5.0","image_asset_urls":{"image_220x220_url":"https://wwcdn.weddingwire.com/vendor/965001_970000/968686/thumbnails/220x220_1495814394-3924dce60b2ac0e0-1490388617786-img3492.jpg","image_sq_48x48_url":"https://wwcdn.weddingwire.com/vendor/965001_970000/968686/thumbnails/48x48_SQ_1495814394-3924dce60b2ac0e0-1490388617786-img3492.jpg","image_sq_96x96_url":"https://wwcdn.weddingwire.com/vendor/965001_970000/968686/thumbnails/96x96_SQ_1495814394-3924dce60b2ac0e0-1490388617786-img3492.jpg","image_400x400_url":"https://wwcdn.weddingwire.com/vendor/965001_970000/968686/thumbnails/400x400_1495814394-3924dce60b2ac0e0-1490388617786-img3492.jpg","image_600x600_url":"https://wwcdn.weddingwire.com/vendor/965001_970000/968686/thumbnails/600x600_1495814394-3924dce60b2ac0e0-1490388617786-img3492.jpg","image_sq_64x64_url":"https://wwcdn.weddingwire.com/vendor/965001_970000/968686/thumbnails/64x64_SQ_1495814394-3924dce60b2ac0e0-1490388617786-img3492.jpg","image_130x130_url":"https://wwcdn.weddingwire.com/vendor/965001_970000/968686/thumbnails/130x130_1495814394-3924dce60b2ac0e0-1490388617786-img3492.jpg","image_sq_130x130_url":"https://wwcdn.weddingwire.com/vendor/965001_970000/968686/thumbnails/130x130_SQ_1495814394-3924dce60b2ac0e0-1490388617786-img3492.jpg"},"vendors_i_prefer":[],"reviews":[{"vendor_comments":"","image_url":"","image_url_assets":{"image_220x220_url":"","image_sq_48x48_url":"","image_sq_96x96_url":"","image_400x400_url":"","image_600x600_url":"","image_sq_64x64_url":"","image_130x130_url":"","image_sq_130x130_url":""},"review_count":1,"review_date":"","reviewer_comments":"Jennifer was absolutely amazing during our planning, pre-ceremony, and ceremony.

The promises box that she creates is individualized and based off of the promises that you and your partner make to one another in the days before the wedding.

She helped create a beautiful memorial section for lost loved ones that could not be present with us, which meant so much to us. There were little details and remarks during the ceremony that really showed that she took the time to know us, and what we wanted in a ceremony. Everything Jennifer did was heartfelt and her sincere personality was loved by everyone. The promises section that Jennifer does was so special and is a memory I know I will cherish forever. It was so fun and eye opening to work on your promises to each other. It made us discuss and appreciate our relationship more than ever before in the months/weeks leading up to our ceremony.
